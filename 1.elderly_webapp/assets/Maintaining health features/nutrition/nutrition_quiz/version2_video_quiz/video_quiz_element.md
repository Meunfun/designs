This feature was initially designed as a static background with multiple-choice questions for users to click through. However, I found it not engaging enough, so I redesigned it as an interactive journey. Instead of a static format, users are guided through the questions via a sequence of videos. A video plays for each question, and if the user answers incorrectly, a fail video is triggered and the flow returns to the previous question. The journey continues only when the correct answer is selected.

The main character was created with the help of ChatGPT and the backgrounds were designed in Canva using a combination of multiple elements.
