This is the full design of a web application developed for my master\'s final project. I designed the entire user interface for this application, which focuses on elderly health and well-being. The main design tools used were Figma and Visily, while most visual elements, such as the logo, cartoon illustrations and feature icons were first created in Canva to ensure consistency and a cohesive look across the site.
